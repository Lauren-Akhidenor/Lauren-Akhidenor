## Featured Projects  

### Climate & Food Systems Analysis  

- **Emono’s Healthy Lifestyle: Complete SQL Database Project**
I developed a comprehensive SQL database to manage and analyze health-focused products, clients, employees, projects, farmers, crops, and sales. The project integrates DDL, DML, ETL, and OLAP processes, enabling efficient operations, sales tracking, employee/project monitoring, and data-driven decision-making for wellness and nutrition initiatives.

**Tools:** SQL Server | OLAP Analytics | ETL Processes

- **Visualizing Maize Variety Adoption & Agronomic Practices in Embu, Kenya**  
I explored how factors like gender, training, and socio-economic status influence maize variety adoption, input use, and farming practices among smallholder farmers in Embu County, Kenya. By building a star-schema data model and developing interactive Power BI dashboards, I revealed key insights on adoption trends, training effectiveness, fertilizer usage, and constraints such as high input costs, pests, and post-harvest losses.

**Tools:** Power BI

- **Quantifying the Economic Burden of Climate-Induced Health Risks in Nigeria**  
I analyzed how health risks like heat stress, malaria, and cholera affect labour productivity and food security in Nigeria. Using OLS regression and logistic models on nationally representative panel data, I combined econometric insights with visual storytelling to highlight economic vulnerabilities.

**Tools:**  Excel |  Power BI |  ArcGIS |  Python

- **Role of Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) in Addressing Challenges of Food Security and Climate Change in Nigeria through Food Price Stabilization and Farmers’ Perception**  

Explored how CSA practices stabilize food prices and strengthen resilience against climate change. I mapped adoption patterns with ArcGIS, built interactive Power BI dashboards, and used Python econometrics to test effectiveness.  

**Tools:**  Power BI | ArcGIS | Python

- **Agricultural Inventory & Climate-Expectation Analysis**  
Designed a relational SQL schema to track agricultural inventory while integrating farmers’ climate expectations into operational and pricing decisions. Automated reports and linked insights to a Power BI dashboard for real-time monitoring.  

**Tools:** SQL | Power BI

- **Influence of Climate Change Expectations on Food Prices**  
Examined the relationship between climate change expectations, sectoral differences (urban vs rural), and food price variations across Nigeria.  

**Tools:** Excel | Python

- **Agricultural Insurance in Northern Nigeria**  
Investigated why poultry farmers under-participate in agricultural insurance. Cleaned and analyzed data in Excel, then built Power BI dashboards to visualize patterns by income, education, and farm size.  

**Tools:** Excel | Power BI

- **Socio-Economic Characteristics of Maize Farmers in Kenya** 
Analyzed data from a field survey in Bungoma County, Kenya, exploring how socio-economic characteristics, farming practices, and access to support services impact maize productivity.  

**Tools:** Excel | SPSS | Power BI

## Optimization & Financial Metrics Projects  

- **Linear Programming in Food Production**  
This project is a comprehensive showcase of three Linear Programming applications in agriculture and food systems, all combined into one README to demonstrate my ability to design and solve optimization problems:  

1. **Nutrient-Cost Optimization**: determining the least-cost feed/production mix that meets nutritional or production requirements.  
2. **Production Scheduling**: allocating limited resources efficiently across different production activities to maximize output.  
3. **Processing & Machine Allocation**: optimizing machine hours and labor to reduce downtime and increase efficiency in small-scale processing plants.  

By combining these models into a single portfolio project, I highlight not just isolated skills, but the versatility of Linear Programming in real-world agricultural and food production decision-making.  

**Tools:** Excel
