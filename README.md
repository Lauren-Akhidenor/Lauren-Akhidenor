# 👋 Hi, I'm Akhidenor Lauren
My vision in life is to be an individual of Global impact contributing to the drive of food security across the world and restoring agricultural dignity to the African continent alongside building a generation of global agricultural impacts. 

I am a food security impact-driven global enthusiast passionate about addressing food insecurity and promoting youth-driven agribusiness in Nigeria and across Africa. I aspire to add value to the ongoing global efforts to combat hunger by leveraging my knowledge in agricultural economics, data analysis, and the practical application of economic models to solve real-world agricultural challenges.

My experience includes working with large-scale survey data such as the General Household Survey (GHS) Panel to analyze food security, climate change health related illnesses alongside labor productivity in agriculture, food prices, climate smart adoration practices, and their economic effects on rural communities, as well as engaging in diverse agriculture-related projects such as insurance amongst famers, genetically modified crops amongst others. 

I am skilled in using tools like Microsoft Excel, Power BI, SPSS, Microsoft SQL and Google Colab to clean, analyze, visualize, and interpret agricultural and economic data.

I am also an advocate for youth empowerment in agripreneurship. My goal is to leverage data-driven insights to support sustainable agricultural development and improve food security outcomes.

I am eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals, contribute to impactful projects, and continue growing as a data enthusiast and agricultural economist.

## 📚 Data Analysis Projects
- **ANALYZING THE PARTICIPATION LEVEL OF POULTRY FARMERS IN AGRICULTURAL INSURANCE IN NORTHERN NIGERIA**
   *This project explores factors influencing the low participation of poultry farmers in agricultural insurance across 7 Northern Nigerian states. It involves data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and visual insights using Excel and Power BI. Socio-economic characteristics such as income, education, and farm size were analyzed to determine their effect on insurance uptake.*

- **SOCIO-ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS, FARMING PRACTICES, AND PRODUCTIVITY OF MAIZE FARMERS IN KENYA (BUNGOMA COUNTY)**  
  *This project analyzes data from a field survey conducted in four sub-counties of Bungoma County—Chwele, Sirisia, Tongaren, and Webuye West. It explores how socio-economic characteristics, farming practices, and access to agricultural support impact maize productivity in the region.*

- **THE INFLUENCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE EXPECTATIONS AND SECTORAL DIFFERENCES ON FOOD PRICES IN NIGERIA**  
  *This project examines the relationship between climate change expectations and food price variations across Nigeria. By analyzing data on climate perceptions, sectoral differences (urban vs rural), and food price trends, the study sheds light on how these factors shape the agricultural market and food security in the country.*

- **🌍 QUANTIFYING THE ECONOMIC BURDEN OF CLIMATE-INDUCED HEALTH RISKS IN NIGERIA**
  *This project examines how Climate-Induced Health Risks (CIHR) such as heat stress, malaria, and cholera affect labour productivity and food security in Nigerian agricultural households. It applies econometric modeling using OLS and logistic regression on nationally representative GHS-Panel data, supported with visual and policy-driven insights.*

- **🌾 AGRICULTURAL INVENTORY & CLIMATE-EXPECTATION ANALYSIS**  
*This project models agricultural inventory while integrating farmers’ climate expectation signals to inform operational, pricing, and restocking decisions. Built with Microsoft SQL Server using T-SQL in SSMS, it highlights relational schema design and data integrity enforcement, use of stored procedures, triggers, and conditional logic for automation, statistical summaries for pricing and restocking recommendations, climate expectation integration for data-driven decision-making and a dynamic Power BI dashboard delivering key performance insights and actionable alerts.*
