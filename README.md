# 👋 Hi, I'm Akhidenor Lauren

A soon to be graduate of Landmark University with the vision of becoming an individual of Global impact contributing to the drive of food security across the world and restoring agricultural dignity to the African continent alongside building a generation of  global agricultural impacts. 

I aspire to add value to the ongoing global efforts to combat hunger by leveraging my knowledge in agricultural economics, data analysis, and the practical application of economic models to solve real-world agricultural challenges.

This drive can be seen in my portfolio and enhancement on social media to make a voice in the agricultural sector. I am eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals, contribute to impactful projects, and continue growing as a data enthusiast and agricultural economist.

## 📚 Data Analysis Projects

- **🌍 QUANTIFYING THE ECONOMIC BURDEN OF CLIMATE-INDUCED HEALTH RISKS IN NIGERIA**
  *This project examines how Climate-Induced Health Risks (CIHR) such as heat stress, malaria, and cholera affect labour productivity and food security in Nigerian agricultural households. It applies econometric modeling using OLS and logistic regression on nationally representative GHS-Panel data, supported with visual and policy-driven insights.*

- **🌱🌍 ROLE OF CLIMATE-SMART AGRICULTURE (CSA) IN ADDRESSING CHALLENGES OF FOOD SECURITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE IN NIGERIA THROUGH FOOD PRICE STABILIZATION AND FARMERS' PERCEPTION**  
  *This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the role of Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) in strengthening Nigeria’s food systems under climate change pressures. Using nationally representative data from the GHS-Panel Wave 5 (2023/2024), it investigates the socioeconomic characteristics of farming households, their perceptions and expectations of climate change, and the extent of CSA adoption across rural and urban sectors. The study further examines the impact of CSA adoption on food prices, evaluates its effectiveness in mitigating climate-related damages, and highlights regional disparities using Power BI dashboards, ArcGIS mapping, and Python econometric analysis. Findings reveal that CSA adoption is universal but uneven in effectiveness associated with price stabilization yet limited in reducing reported climate damages. These insights provide evidence for targeted policy interventions, improved early warning systems, and expanded CSA infrastructure to enhance resilience and long-term food security in Nigeria.*

- **🌾 AGRICULTURAL INVENTORY & CLIMATE-EXPECTATION ANALYSIS**  
*This project involves the display of data manipulation skills to model agricultural inventory while integrating farmers’ climate expectation signals to inform operational, pricing, and restocking decisions. Built with Microsoft SQL Server using T-SQL in SSMS, it highlights relational schema design and data integrity enforcement, use of stored procedures, triggers, and conditional logic for automation, statistical summaries for pricing and restocking recommendations, climate expectation integration for data driven decision making and a dynamic Power BI dashboard delivering key performance insights and actionable alerts.*

- **THE INFLUENCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE EXPECTATIONS AND SECTORAL DIFFERENCES ON FOOD PRICES IN NIGERIA**  
  *This project examines the relationship between climate change expectations and food price variations across Nigeria. By analyzing data on climate perceptions, sectoral differences (urban vs rural), and food price trends, the study sheds light on how these factors shape the agricultural market and food security in the country.*

- **ANALYZING THE PARTICIPATION LEVEL OF POULTRY FARMERS IN AGRICULTURAL INSURANCE IN NORTHERN NIGERIA**
   *This project explores factors influencing the low participation of poultry farmers in agricultural insurance across 7 Northern Nigerian states. It involves data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and visual insights using Excel and Power BI. Socio-economic characteristics such as income, education, and farm size were analyzed to determine their effect on insurance uptake.*

- **SOCIO-ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS, FARMING PRACTICES, AND PRODUCTIVITY OF MAIZE FARMERS IN KENYA (BUNGOMA COUNTY)**  
  *This project analyzes data from a field survey conducted in four sub-counties of Bungoma County in kenya which were Chwele, Sirisia, Tongaren, and Webuye West. It explores how socio-economic characteristics, farming practices, and access to agricultural support impact maize productivity in the region.*

 ## 📚 Financial Metrics Analysis

- **🌱 COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF ORGANIC VS INTEGRATED FARMING FOR AMARANTH & CORCHORUS**  
  *This project evaluates the economic viability of two farming approaches: strictly organic and integrated (organic + fertilizer + pesticide) for Amaranth and Corchorus. Using detailed cost projections, revenue forecasts, and financial metrics like ROI, BCR, NPV, and IRR, the analysis identifies the most profitable strategy for sustainable small-scale farming.*

- **ENHANCING SUSTAINABLE CABBAGE PRODUCTION THROUGH MYCORRHIZAL INOCULATION: A COST-BENEFIT PERSPECTIVE**  
  *An experimental project assessing the agronomic and economic effects of mycorrhizal fungi on cabbage farming in Kenya, aimed at improving soil health, productivity, and profitability for smallholder farmers.*
