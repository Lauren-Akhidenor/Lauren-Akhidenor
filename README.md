## 📊 Featured Projects  

### 🌍 Climate & Food Systems Analysis  

- **🌍 Quantifying the Economic Burden of Climate-Induced Health Risks in Nigeria**  
I analyzed how health risks like heat stress, malaria, and cholera affect labour productivity and food security in Nigeria. Using OLS regression and logistic models on nationally representative panel data, I combined econometric insights with visual storytelling to highlight economic vulnerabilities.

**Tools:** 📑 Excel | 📊 Power BI | 🗺️ ArcGIS | 🐍 Python

- **🌱 Role of Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) in Nigeria**  
Explored how CSA practices stabilize food prices and strengthen resilience against climate change. I mapped adoption patterns with ArcGIS, built interactive Power BI dashboards, and used Python econometrics to test effectiveness.  

**Tools:**  📊 Power BI | 🗺️ ArcGIS | 🐍 Python

- **📊 Agricultural Inventory & Climate-Expectation Analysis**  
Designed a relational SQL schema to track agricultural inventory while integrating farmers’ climate expectations into operational and pricing decisions. Automated reports and linked insights to a Power BI dashboard for real-time monitoring.  

**Tools:** 🗄️ SQL | 📊 Power BI  

[![📊 Agro Inventory & Climate 📈](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-📊_Agro_Inventory_&_Climate_📈-F5F5DC?logo=github&logoColor=white&labelColor=800020)](https://github.com/Lauren-Akhidenor/agro-inventory-climate-analysis/blob/main/README.md)  



- **📈 Influence of Climate Change Expectations on Food Prices**  
Examined the relationship between climate change expectations, sectoral differences (urban vs rural), and food price variations across Nigeria.  

**Tools:** 📑 Excel | 🐍 Python  

[![Food Price & Climate](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Food_Price_&_Climate-F5F5DC?logo=github&logoColor=white&labelColor=800020)](https://github.com/Lauren-Akhidenor/Foodprice_ClimateChange)  



- **🐔 Agricultural Insurance in Northern Nigeria**  
Investigated why poultry farmers under-participate in agricultural insurance. Cleaned and analyzed data in Excel, then built Power BI dashboards to visualize patterns by income, education, and farm size.  

**Tools:** 📑 Excel | 📊 Power BI

## ⚙️ Optimization & Financial Metrics Projects  

- **🟢 Linear Programming in Food Production**  
This project is a comprehensive showcase of three Linear Programming applications in agriculture and food systems, all combined into one README to demonstrate my ability to design and solve optimization problems:  

1. **Nutrient-Cost Optimization**: determining the least-cost feed/production mix that meets nutritional or production requirements.  
2. **Production Scheduling**: allocating limited resources efficiently across different production activities to maximize output.  
3. **Processing & Machine Allocation**: optimizing machine hours and labor to reduce downtime and increase efficiency in small-scale processing plants.  

By combining these models into a single portfolio project, I highlight not just isolated skills, but the versatility of Linear Programming in real-world agricultural and food production decision-making.  

**Tools:** 📑 Excel
